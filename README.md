# Vuetify 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Starting from `electron-vite`, I added `vuetify`, `vue-router` and `pinia` to the bunch.
There was native electron support in Vuetify v2, but I never got to use it and since it's not present in v3... Well, I went and did something :smiley:

## Quick Setup

```sh
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/rbgtk/vuetify-app.git

# enter the project directory
cd vuetify-app

# install dependency
npm install

# develop
npm run dev
```

You may see I'm referencing a lot from [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.github.io/) so please check out their website and docs!
Another bountiful source of information can be found at [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) and of course our beloved [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) :heart:

There's no more humbling feeling than being able to build on the shoulders of giants, so if you can, support the original maintainers of all the mentioned packages.
