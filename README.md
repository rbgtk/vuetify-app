# Vuetify 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This project start from `electron-vite` using the `vue` template. With some hacking and slashing, it now runs `vuetify`, `vue-router`, and `pinia` as well :smiley:

There's no more humbling feeling than being able to build on the shoulders of giants, so if you can, support the original maintainers of all the mentioned packages :heart:
